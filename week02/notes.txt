WebGL and OpenGL - Right hand rule
GPU only deals with triangles

from frag shader : "void main(void){...}" -- why does the function take a void argument?

vectors will be referred to as column vector (objects)

bottle neck created when cpu sends verticies to gpu. Triangle strips minimize number of verticies to be sent. glsl knows to interpret verticies.

if type='other' in html in <script> tag, the script won't be evaluated

hw is to play with frag shader...

uniform - variables that don't change over space. passed in from cpu
attribute - handed in from cpu, unique for each vertext
varying - created in vert shader and output.  passed from vert to frag.

js - don't put methods in constructor of objects. add to prototype so they don't get called every time a new instance is made.

lib js - //Assign attribute aPosition... <-go over this function ???

swizzling:
	take a vec3 and refer to vec3.x or vec3.xy or vec3.xx to get components

dot product - how much vectors line up (two vecs at 90deg will yield 0)
